# Analysis of Student's at the American and European Yunguseng Dojangs

## Background
The Yungseng Dojang--comprising an American and European school--is an
online go school run by In-seong Hwang. He is a very strong amatuer go player
from South Korea currently living in France.

I was a member of the American Yunguseng Dojang in Spring 2015 and Winter
2016. I really enjoyed the program, and my skill at the game of go increased
quite a bit during the time of my enrollment.

Since I was familiar with the YD websites, I knew that there was quite a
bit of information available about student performance while at the school.
Further, I knew that every student in the school has an account on the KGS
Go Server. The archives of this server are public. So, I had access to
quite a few game records for each student.

With all of this data available, this seemed like an excellent topic for
analysis.

## Web-scraping
The first step in most projects is gathering the data. This project is not an exception.

There were two relevant sources of data for this project. I'll discuss each in turn below.
